                <h1> About me </h1>
                <p> My name is Ryan Harrold, and I am a 21 year old Game developer, based in Brisbane, Australia. I have been trained in
                    both programming and game design. I can write in c#, java and c++. I am currently undergoing a bachelor of Games and
                    interactive environmants at Queensland University of Technology.</p>

                <p>I have a great passion for programming, rivaled only by my love of games. I am comfortable with unity, but also have experiece
                    with custom/homemade game-engines. I have been programming since I was 13 years old, starting off attempting to make minecraft
                    mods (I didn't get too far as a 13 year old though). That was my Gateway drug into the world of game programming/game development
                    and I quickly started to design and make my own [small] games.</p>
                <p>I have come a long way since then, and am looking forward to continuing to hone my skills and to create fun games for others to enjoy.</p>
