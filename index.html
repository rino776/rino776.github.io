                <h1> About me </h1>
                <p> My name is Ryan Harrold, and I am a 25 year old Software Engineer, based in Brisbane, Australia. I have been trained in
                    both programming and game design, having completed a Bachelor of games and interactive environments in 2021. I currently
                    work as a software engineer, working on a graphics engine used in construction software.</p>

                <p>I have a great passion for programming, rivaled only by my love of games. I am comfortable in a range of Languages and
                    technologies, including C++, C#, and OpenGL. I am also confident that I can learn new technologies as required. I
                    first started learning how to program when I was 13 years old, seeking to understand how the games that I love
                    were created.
                </p>

                <p>I've come a long way since then, and look forward to learning more and continue honing my skills.</p>
