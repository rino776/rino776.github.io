		<p>This site holds information about any personal projects I have worked on. </p>
		<p>I am a 17 year old programmer, having taught myself Java, python, html, css as well as a little bit of c++. I first started teaching myself to program when I was 13, and have enjoyed every minute of it. </p>
		<p>My desire is to become a software engineer and a games developer. So far, I have made only a couple of small games, however I hope to continue learning and improving until I am able to make great, enjoyable games.
		</p>
		<p>I also enjoy 3D modelling, and so on this website you will not only find links to download any finished projects, but to also view 3D models that I have created.
		</p>
		<p>Finally, if for any reason you need to contact me, there are links at the bottom of each page to my Github, Twitter and Email.</p>
