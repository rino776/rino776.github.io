                <h1>New Game Project</h1>

<p>When deciding on a new project, it is important to first think about constraints. This may seem counter-intuitive, but in my experience it is through constraints that design is able to occur. Given the option of limitless choices, we will often be frozen with indecision. As soon as you allocate some constraints, creatively working within those constraints creates an opportunity to innovate and create something new.</p>

<p>So what should my constraints be? One place to start is to look at what I already can and can’t do. This is an opportunity for me to improve myself, to learn new skills. And so, I must first look at what I already can do - that is, what have I done in the past?

<p>My current portfolio is relatively diversified - I have done projects in java using LWJGL, creating simple games from the ground up, playing with low level graphics programming and learning the why behind a lot of decisions in game engine design. I have also done plenty of projects in unity - indeed, you could say it is my comfort zone as far as game engines are concerned. I have mostly done projects that target pc, but I have made games for VR as well.</p>

<p>So what are the gaps in my current portfolio? What can I add to it that I haven't done before? One possibility is multiplayer. Multiplayer is something that I enjoy. Looking at the games I have spent the most time on, they are all multiplayer games. There is something to be said for playing games with a bunch of mates, throwing banter at each other as you try to compete against each other (even when the goal is to work together). Creating something that I would enjoy playing is part of my core design ideals - if I don’t enjoy what I create, I do not like creating it. And so, the main core constraint for my project will be “multiplayer” not local multiplayer though - playing on the same machine; I have done that already. But, multiplayer as in playing on different machines on a different network across the internet.</p>

<p>"Multiplayer" unfortunately is not a viable game concept by itself. The trick is creating something that would be fun playing with a bunch of mates. As mentioned, we tend to compete against each other even in co-op games. So, the second constraint would be a co-op game that allows competition amongst players working together for a common goal. Doing so would target multiple player types as defined by richard bartle, mainly the ‘achiever’ and ‘explorer’ player types.(Bartle, 2009) and hopefully attract groups of people, rather than individuals.</p>

<p>Finally, the third constraint is for it to have RPG-like elements - this is another gap in my portfolio, I have never created something as simple as a couple of skills on a cooldown. This is where I need to talk a bit about scope - “multiplayer RPG” is probably synonymous with “over scoped” and “perpetual development”. And so, it shall only be RPG like- that is, possessing some of the elements in RPGs, and not be an RPG in and of itself. And so, a sub constraint of this is to focus on just one class, and keep it super simple.</p>

<p>And so, with those constraints in mind, the project which I shall be working on is tentatively called ‘healing simulator’ (I’m not happy with the name at the moment). It is a small, co-op multiplayer game where you have to out-heal your allies. You play in a small raid team, with tanks and dps that are literally ‘bots’ (braindead, and unable to think for themselves) your job is to keep them alive long enough for them to defeat the Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG). But, you are not the only healer - the other players are also healers. You are to work together with them to keep the bots alive, but also compete against each other as to who can heal the most by the end of the game.</p>

<p>Currently, all the details are not 100% fleshed out, however this is enough of a direction for me to begin the project - In my experience, I’ve noticed that starting out with a general idea, and then iterating as I build, overcoming various obstacles as the come up, is how I work best.</p>

<p>I believe that this project will help me to better my skills as a game developer. It will help me to learn skills that are important and fundamental in the industry that I wish to go into. Plus, it is a project that I think would be fun to play, as well as fun to make.</p>
